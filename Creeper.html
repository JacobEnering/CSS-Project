Creeper, oh man-<br><br>
So we back in the mine, got our pick axe swinging from side to side,-<br>
Side, side to side-<br>
This task a grueling one, hope to find some diamonds tonight, night, night-<br>
Diamonds tonight-<br>
Heads up, you hear a sound, turn around and look up, total shock fills your body,-<br>
Oh no it's you again,-<br>
I could never forget those eyes, eyes, eyes,-<br>
Eyes, eyes, eyes-<br><br>
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's trying to steal all our stuff again,-<br>
'Cause baby tonight, you grab your pick, shovel and bolt again,-<br>
And run, run until it's done, done, until the sun comes up in the morn'-<br>
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's trying to steal all our stuff again-<br><br>
Just when you think you're safe, overhear some hissing from right behind,-<br>
Right, right behind-<br>
That's a nice life you have, shame it's gotta end at this time, time, time,-<br>
Time, time, time, time-<br>
Blows up, then your health bar drops, you could use a 1-up, get inside don't be tardy,-<br>
So now you're stuck in there, half a heart is left but don't die, die, die-<br>
Die, die, die, die-<br><br>
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's trying to steal all your stuff again,-<br>
'Cause baby tonight, you grab your pick, shovel and bolt again,-<br>
And run, run until it's done, done, until the sun comes up in the morn'-<br>
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's trying to steal all your stuff again,-<br><br>
Creepers, you're mine-<br>
Dig up diamonds, and craft those diamonds and make some armor,-<br>
Get it baby, go and forge that like you so, MLG pro,-<br>
The sword's made of diamonds, so come at me bro-<br>
Training in your room under the torch light,-<br>
Hone that form to get you ready for the big fight,-<br>
Every single day and the whole night,-<br>
Creeper's out prowlin' - alright-<br>
Look at me, look at you,-<br>
Take my revenge that's what I'm gonna do,-<br>
I'm a warrior baby, what else is new,-<br>
And my blade's gonna tear through you-<br>
Bring it-<br><br>
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's trying to steal all our stuff again,-<br>
Yeah baby tonight, grab your sword, armor and gold, take your revenge,-<br>
So fight, fight like it's the last, last night of your life, life, show them your bite,-<br>
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's trying to steal all our stuff again,-<br>
'Cause baby tonight, you grab your pick, shovel and bolt again,-<br>
And run, run until it's done, done, until the sun comes up in the morn'-<br>
'Cause baby tonight, the creepers tried to steal all our stuff again<br></div>
